# 🚀 Aero-Predict: Drag Coefficient Prediction from 3D Models

Aero-Predict is an AI-powered tool that predicts the **drag coefficient (Cd)** of car models based on their **3D geometry** (.obj/.stl files). It extracts geometric features, applies **machine learning**, and provides quick insights for **aerodynamic optimization**.
